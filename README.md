# Arduino: Measuring atmospheric pollution

## Hardware

This project can be used with any Arduino motherboard, using a LCD screen for display and a [Nova PM SDS011 sensor](https://components101.com/sensors/nova-pm-sensor-sds011-pinout-features-working-applications-datasheet) as a particle counter.

## Software

This is a simple project used on an Arduino motherboard, using a LCD display and the SDS011 particle sensor.
The sensor counts PM2.5 and PM10 particles present in the air and displays it on the LCD display. Measurements are updated every second on the screen.
